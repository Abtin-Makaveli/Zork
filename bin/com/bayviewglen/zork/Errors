Errors:
Before I start the game I see exceptions being thrown.
When I choose the wrong direction I get the incorrect direction message, but then errors are thrown and I cannot continue.
Even if I go the right direction, I am faced with a bunch of errors.
If I try to eat flashlight, I get the message(good) but errors still pop up(bad).
Typing take will crash the game completely.

Bills Reflection:
Communication was a big improvement for me in this project, Zork depended heavily on successful communication between group members.
For example two people cannot work on the same thing at once, so if we where to find an error or fix something we had to type a warning 
into chat saying we are about to edit something. Our group took two days to successfully set up everything and have a warning system on
discord, with this we were able to work together fairly well and there where only a few mistakes and accidental overrides.The communication
in my opinion is the most important thing in this project and reflecting on it i think our group did very well.

Ben's Reflection:
Throughout this project, I learned many different things when it came to communication and collaboration. 
Having people that I have worked with in the past in my Zork group was great, however, having 2 members in a different class came with some challenges.
 Communication was a necessity as weren’t in the same class together.
 In order to succeed, it was important that we all understand the same necessary information, problems, ideas, and goals to complete the project.
 I found that our group was able to do this fairly well between one another, with only a few mistakes and accidental overriding. 
Collaboration was another part of our project that I learned a lot about.
 I already knew coming into this project that different people were going to do different work loads when it came to coding.
 Being aware of this, our group made sure to assign the work that requires a lower difficulty of coding and no coding at all to the members that weren’t as skilled in coding. 
We overall learned how to work well together very well.
